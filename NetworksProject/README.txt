Implement a file transfer protocol.

You will use TCP or UDP to transfer the file.

1. open sockets

2. send files using appropriate transport protocol.

3. Break the file into packets and re-assemble them at destination.

Your grading will be based on:

1. Demo - you will be asked to send text file, jpeg, pdf etc .. files.  The received desitnation should display the correct file.

2. Interview during demo - questions about the project and code (to make sure you wrote the code)

3. Report - about 2 pages to document your design
